Therefore, a randomized study design is needed to account for all\nknown and unknown confounders. While randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs)\nare often used to assess the effects of interventions, this might not be the\nideal design for anti-stress interventions. Firstly, RCTs focus on the outcome\neffect on the group level but neglect intra-individual effects. However, for an\nanti-stress intervention, it is much more interesting to analyze the effects of\nthe intervention within the individual (which can differ from between-group\neffects). Additionally, population-level effects can subsequently be estimated\nfrom the data collected in the N-of-1 trial as well, thereby ensuring no\ninsights are lost. Secondly, due to the repeated measurements in an N-of-1\ntrial, temporal changes can be analyzed. Thirdly, owing to advanced applications\nlike StudyU, the interventions can be applied, and the outcomes\nmeasured, in the context of daily life. Due to these (and additional)\nadvantages, N-of-1 trials are "regarded [to be] at the top of the evidence\nhierarchy [...] over and above systematic reviews of RCTs" (Kwasnicka et al.,\n2019) for individual treatment choices.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"digital-application-of-intervention-through-studyu",children:"Digital Application of Intervention through StudyU"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The StudyU platform contributes to the ASIP Study by providing a user-friendly\ninterface that manages and applies the intervention (through audio/video files)\nand collects the participant-reported outcome measures.
