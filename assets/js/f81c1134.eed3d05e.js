Valentin Vetter).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nPhysicians in Germany generally experience a high level of psychosocial stress.\\nThis holds true for those working in hospitals, general practitioners, and\\nphysicians in outpatient clinics. It is a well-known fact that high levels of\\nstress negatively impact the physical and mental health of individuals. In\\nphysicians\' case, however, high stress levels have also been identified as a\\nreason for suboptimal quality of medical care. This includes deviations from\\nstandard procedures, a decrease in the quality of the doctor-patient\\nrelationship, and treatment errors. Potentially substantial structural changes\\nin the organization and management of health care as well as in the way\\nphysicians are compensated by health insurers would be required to achieve\\nsustainable improvements for medical personnel. Hence, a more immediate and\\neasy-to-implement solution to reduce perceived stress is needed.\\n\\n## The Intervention\\n\\nAn intervention to improve the stress level of physicians must meet certain\\ncriteria to increase the likelihood of being implemented in everyday life and\\nleading to sustainable improvements. First, the intervention needs to be easy to\\nlearn and brief, as time is often limited during a busy workday. Second, the\\nintervention should be conducted without additional tools. Third, the\\nintervention needs to be successful in reducing stress. All the criteria listed\\nabove are fulfilled by two techniques that have been intensively studied over\\nthe past decades: breathwork and mindfulness-based meditation techniques.\\n\\n## Why Use an N-of-1 Design\\n\\nPerception of stress is highly individual and dependent on a large number of\\nvariables, both known and unknown, which are partly hard to measure accurately.\\nThe same is potentially true for the effect of an anti-stress intervention on\\nstress levels. Therefore, a randomized study design is needed to account for all\\nknown and unknown confounders. While randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs)\\nare often used to assess the effects of interventions, this might not be the\\nideal design for anti-stress interventions. Firstly, RCTs focus on the outcome\\neffect on the group level but neglect intra-individual effects. However, for an\\nanti-stress intervention, it is much more interesting to analyze the effects of\\nthe intervention within the individual (which can differ from between-group\\neffects). Additionally, population-level effects can subsequently be estimated\\nfrom the data collected in the N-of-1 trial as well, thereby ensuring no\\ninsights are lost. Secondly, due to the repeated measurements in an N-of-1\\ntrial, temporal changes can be analyzed. Thirdly, owing to advanced applications\\nlike StudyU, the interventions can be applied, and the outcomes\\nmeasured, in the context of daily life. Due to these (and additional)\\nadvantages, N-of-1 trials are \\"regarded [to be] at the top of the evidence\\nhierarchy [...] over and above systematic reviews of RCTs\\" (Kwasnicka et al.,\\n2019) for individual treatment choices.\\n\\n## Digital Application of Intervention through StudyU\\n\\nThe StudyU platform contributes to the ASIP Study by providing a user-friendly\\ninterface that manages and applies the intervention (through audio/video files)\\nand collects the participant-reported outcome measures. The application will\\nensure good adherence to the study protocol by presenting the current phase of\\nthe trial in a structured and clear way, as well as through push notifications."},{"id":"studyu-fab-study-antidepressant-discontinuation","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/studyu-fab-study-antidepressant-discontinuation","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-16-studyu-fab-study-antidepressant-discontinuation.md","title":"StudyU\'s Role in Easing Antidepressant Discontinuation in the FAB-Study","description":"We are pleased to announce the publication of the first research paper utilizing the StudyU platform","date":"2023-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.775,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"studyu-fab-study-antidepressant-discontinuation","title":"StudyU\'s Role in Easing Antidepressant Discontinuation in the FAB-Study"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Innovative Anti-Stress Study among Physicians at Charit\xe9","permalink":"/blog/anti-stress-study-among-physicians"},"nextItem":{"title":"Introducing StudyU to the German Federal Minister of Health","permalink":"/blog/federal-health-minister-meets-studyu"}},"content":"We are pleased to announce the publication of the first research paper utilizing the StudyU platform\\nfor a medical study.

N-of-1 trials compare two interventions for each participant to identify the most\\neffective one. Comprising the **StudyU Designer** for specifying and publishing trials and the **StudyU App** for\\nparticipant engagement, the StudyU platform empowers clinicians and researchers globally to conduct secure digital\\nN-of-1 trials. **StudyU** envisions a future of more accessible and collaborative personalized treatments, available as\\na free research tool and a versatile resource for clinical practice.\\n\\n## Addressing the Antidepressant Discontinuation Challenge\\n\\nAntidepressant discontinuation is a complex issue, with many individuals facing adverse effects and symptoms that hinder\\nthe process of stopping medication. This can result in unnecessary, long-term use of antidepressants. The FAB-Study\\nacknowledges this challenge and proposes a solution around the concept of N-of-1 trials, which involves individual\\npatients using the **StudyU App** to provide personalized insights into their treatment.\\n\\n## The FAB-Study: A Closer Look\\n\\nThe FAB-Study involves conducting a series of randomized, single-blinded N-of-1 trials. In total, 20 patients with fully\\nremitted DSM-V major depressive disorder, who are experiencing moderate to severe discontinuation symptoms after\\nstopping antidepressants, participate in the study.\\n\\nEach N-of-1 trial consists of two cycles, each spanning eight weeks. Within these cycles, patients experience two-week\\nalternating periods of open-label placebo (OLP) treatment and no treatment, in a randomized order. Their self-reported\\ndiscontinuation symptoms are captured twice daily via our smartphone application, **StudyU**. Additionally, the study\\ntracks their expectations about discontinuation symptoms and mood states.\\n\\nMore information about the study is available in the open access paper: [Study protocol: combined N-of-1 trials to assess open-label placebo treatment for antidepressant discontinuation symptoms [FAB-study]](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-023-05184-y)\\n\\n## How StudyU supported the FAB-Study\\n\\nFor the successful execution of a digital N-of-1 study, supportive and patient-friendly tools are essential. Due to the\\nunique nature of N-of-1 trials and their special requirements, the N-of-trial tailored platform **StudyU** served as a\\nparticularly helpful instrument during the implementation of the FAB-Study:\\n\\n> \\"The new StudyU platform greatly supported the FAB-Study, by serving as an easy-to-use and cost-effective therapeutic\\ntool for us.

We will\\ndefinitely consider using StudyU for future N-of-1 studies.\\"\\n>\\n> -Amke M\xfcller, study director of the first medical study utilizing StudyU\\n\\n## Promising Potential\\n\\nThe results of the FAB-Study may provide valuable insights into the clinical use of open-label placebos for treating\\nantidepressant discontinuation symptoms. Furthermore, the study not only addresses the clinical challenge at hand but\\nalso investigates the feasibility and applicability of a series of N-of-1 trials in a clinical discontinuation trial. \\nSuch insights could pave the way for more personalized, patient-centric treatments.\\n\\nAs N-of-1 studies become more widespread, digital N-of-1 platforms could play a vital role in the future in supporting\\npersonalized healthcare. They provide the infrastructure needed to streamline the trial process, from specifying \\ninterventions to real-time data collection and analysis. In addition, digital N-of-1 platforms play a key role in the\\nadoption of N-of-1 studies, as traditional analog methods had limitations in their implementation.\\n\\nWith digital platforms, such as **StudyU**, trials can be conducted remotely or via smartphones, enhancing participant \\nengagement and ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the data. The scalability and efficiency they offer make N-of-1\\ntrials more accessible and practical for personalized treatment assessment, holding great promise for the future of\\nhealthcare.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAs the developers of the **StudyU** platform, we are pleased to see **StudyU** being actively used in health research.\\nIt makes us proud to see how **StudyU** contributes to an important research topic in the field of antidepressant\\ndiscontinuation.
