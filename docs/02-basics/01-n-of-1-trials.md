Traditionally, in our health system, treatment guidelines and health recommendations have been
developed based on results of studies of large groups of individuals. However, the analysis of such
large population-based studies only gives insights into factors affecting diseases and treatments on
average. Hence, these results do not allow meaningful predictions whether an intervention will help
a given single individual. For example, major drugs in therapeutic areas including asthma,
depression, diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis have only shown an efficacy in 50%-60% of patients.
Similarly, the effect of health interventions and lifestyle changes on chronic disease and health
outcomes on an individual level if often unclear.

N-of-1 trials provide a framework to evaluate personalized treatments and derive invididual
treatment effects. More specifically, N-of-1 trials are multi-crossover randomized controlled trials
in a single participant, i.e. where the participant follows the different interventions of the study
in a pre-specified or randomized order, and the outcome (e.g. improvement of lower back pain or
rheumatoid arthritis pain) is compared between interventions.

If you would like to learn more about N-of-1 trials, we recommend you to watch the short video
["What is an N-of-1 trial?"](https://palsforhealth.com/Pals/Article/What%20is%20an%20N-of-1%20trial)
which was created by our [collaboration](/docs/basics/studies) partners at
[Weill Cornell Medicine](https://goyallab.weill.cornell.edu/research/clinical-trials).

With StudyU, we are building a platform called StudyU, developing and evaluating necessary tools and
methods for the platform, and applying the platform to derive and evaluate individualized treatment
effects. Read more about it [here](/docs/02-basics/02-studyu-platform.md).
