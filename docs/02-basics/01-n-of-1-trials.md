# The Concept of N-of-1 Trials

Traditionally, in our health system, treatment guidelines and health recommendations have been
developed based on results of studies of large groups of individuals. However, the analysis of such
large population-based studies only gives insights into factors affecting diseases and treatments on
average. Hence, these results do not allow meaningful predictions whether an intervention will help
a given single individual. For example, major drugs in therapeutic areas including asthma,
depression, diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis have only shown an efficacy in 50%-60% of patients.
Similarly, the effect of health interventions and lifestyle changes on chronic disease and health
outcomes on an individual level if often unclear.

N-of-1 trials provide a framework to evaluate personalized treatments and derive invididual
treatment effects. More specifically, N-of-1 trials are multi-crossover randomized controlled trials
in a single participant, i.e. where the participant follows the different interventions of the study
in a pre-specified or randomized order, and the outcome (e.g. improvement of lower back pain or
rheumatoid arthritis pain) is compared between interventions.

Here, we are building a platform called StudyU, developing and evaluating necessary tools and
methods for the platform, and applying the platform to derive and evaluate individualized treatment
effects.
