<p>The study, titled "Enhancing Digital N-of-1 Trial: A Comprehensive Exploration of User and Clinician
Engagement, Motivations, and Experiences in Ghana Using the StudyMe and StudyU Apps," focuses on
exploring how digital tools can be used to design personalized trials.</p>
<p>Clinicians use StudyU to design these trials, capturing valuable data on
feasibility and design challenges in low-resource settings like Ghana. We believe this addresses
critical gaps in the personalized medicine landscape in Ghana. We seek to suggest refinements,
enhancements and functionality of the <a href="https://hpi.de/lippert/projects/studyu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StudyMe and StudyU</a>
applications, improving user experiences across diverse geographical and technological contexts.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The "Anti-Stress Intervention Among Physicians (ASIP)" Study utilizes
StudyU to investigate the following intriguing and pertinent research
question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can the everyday level of perceived stress be reduced in a fast and
easy-to-implement manner?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project will be conducted in cooperation with the <a href="https://iph.charite.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Institute for Public
Health at Charité</a> – Universitätsmedizin Berlin
(Principal Investigator: Dr. med. Valentin Vetter).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="background">Background<a href="https://www.studyu.health/blog/anti-stress-study-among-physicians#background" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Background" title="Direct link to Background">​</a></h2>
<p>Physicians in Germany generally experience a high level of psychosocial stress.
This holds true for those working in hospitals, general practitioners, and
physicians in outpatient clinics. It is a well-known fact that high levels of
stress negatively impact the physical and mental health of individuals. In
physicians' case, however, high stress levels have also been identified as a
reason for suboptimal quality of medical care. This includes deviations from
standard procedures, a decrease in the quality of the doctor-patient
relationship, and treatment errors. Potentially substantial structural changes
in the organization and management of health care as well as in the way
physicians are compensated by health insurers would be required to achieve
sustainable improvements for medical personnel. Hence, a more immediate and
easy-to-implement solution to reduce perceived stress is needed.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-intervention">The Intervention<a href="https://www.studyu.health/blog/anti-stress-study-among-physicians#the-intervention" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Intervention" title="Direct link to The Intervention">​</a></h2>
<p>An intervention to improve the stress level of physicians must meet certain
criteria to increase the likelihood of being implemented in everyday life and
leading to sustainable improvements. First, the intervention needs to be easy to
learn and brief, as time is often limited during a busy workday. Second, the
intervention should be conducted without additional tools. Third, the
intervention needs to be successful in reducing stress. All the criteria listed
above are fulfilled by two techniques that have been intensively studied over
the past decades: breathwork and mindfulness-based meditation techniques.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-use-an-n-of-1-design">Why Use an N-of-1 Design<a href="https://www.studyu.health/blog/anti-stress-study-among-physicians#why-use-an-n-of-1-design" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Use an N-of-1 Design" title="Direct link to Why Use an N-of-1 Design">​</a></h2>
<p>Perception of stress is highly individual and dependent on a large number of
variables, both known and unknown, which are partly hard to measure accurately.
The same is potentially true for the effect of an anti-stress intervention on
stress levels. Therefore, a randomized study design is needed to account for all
known and unknown confounders. While randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs)
are often used to assess the effects of interventions, this might not be the
ideal design for anti-stress interventions. Firstly, RCTs focus on the outcome
effect on the group level but neglect intra-individual effects. However, for an
anti-stress intervention, it is much more interesting to analyze the effects of
the intervention within the individual (which can differ from between-group
effects). Additionally, population-level effects can subsequently be estimated
from the data collected in the N-of-1 trial as well, thereby ensuring no
insights are lost. Secondly, due to the repeated measurements in an N-of-1
trial, temporal changes can be analyzed. Thirdly, owing to advanced applications
like StudyU, the interventions can be applied, and the outcomes
measured, in the context of daily life. Due to these (and additional)
advantages, N-of-1 trials are "regarded [to be] at the top of the evidence
hierarchy [...] over and above systematic reviews of RCTs" (Kwasnicka et al.,
2019) for individual treatment choices.</p>

<p>The StudyU platform contributes to the ASIP Study by providing a user-friendly
interface that manages and applies the intervention (through audio/video files)
and collects the participant-reported outcome measures. The application will
ensure good adherence to the study protocol by presenting the current phase of
the trial in a structured and clear way, as well as through push notifications.</p>]]></content>

<p>Antidepressant discontinuation is a complex issue, with many individuals facing adverse effects and symptoms that hinder
the process of stopping medication. This can result in unnecessary, long-term use of antidepressants. The FAB-Study
acknowledges this challenge and proposes a solution around the concept of N-of-1 trials, which involves individual
patients using the <strong>StudyU App</strong> to provide personalized insights into their treatment.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-fab-study-a-closer-look">The FAB-Study: A Closer Look<a href="https://www.studyu.health/blog/studyu-fab-study-antidepressant-discontinuation#the-fab-study-a-closer-look" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The FAB-Study: A Closer Look" title="Direct link to The FAB-Study: A Closer Look">​</a></h2>
<p>The FAB-Study involves conducting a series of randomized, single-blinded N-of-1 trials. In total, 20 patients with fully
remitted DSM-V major depressive disorder, who are experiencing moderate to severe discontinuation symptoms after
stopping antidepressants, participate in the study.</p>
<p>Each N-of-1 trial consists of two cycles, each spanning eight weeks. Within these cycles, patients experience two-week
alternating periods of open-label placebo (OLP) treatment and no treatment, in a randomized order. Their self-reported
discontinuation symptoms are captured twice daily via our smartphone application, <strong>StudyU</strong>. Additionally, the study
tracks their expectations about discontinuation symptoms and mood states.</p>
<p>More information about the study is available in the open access paper: <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-023-05184-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Study protocol: combined N-of-1 trials to assess open-label placebo treatment for antidepressant discontinuation symptoms [FAB-study]</a></p>

<p>For the successful execution of a digital N-of-1 study, supportive and patient-friendly tools are essential. Due to the
unique nature of N-of-1 trials and their special requirements, the N-of-trial tailored platform <strong>StudyU</strong> served as a
particularly helpful instrument during the implementation of the FAB-Study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The new StudyU platform greatly supported the FAB-Study, by serving as an easy-to-use and cost-effective therapeutic
tool for us. Working with StudyU proved to be a pleasant experience for both the researchers and our patients. We will
definitely consider using StudyU for future N-of-1 studies."</p>
<p>-Amke Müller, study director of the first medical study utilizing StudyU</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="promising-potential">Promising Potential<a href="https://www.studyu.health/blog/studyu-fab-study-antidepressant-discontinuation#promising-potential" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Promising Potential" title="Direct link to Promising Potential">​</a></h2>
<p>The results of the FAB-Study may provide valuable insights into the clinical use of open-label placebos for treating
antidepressant discontinuation symptoms. Furthermore, the study not only addresses the clinical challenge at hand but
also investigates the feasibility and applicability of a series of N-of-1 trials in a clinical discontinuation trial.
Such insights could pave the way for more personalized, patient-centric treatments.</p>
<p>As N-of-1 studies become more widespread, digital N-of-1 platforms could play a vital role in the future in supporting
personalized healthcare. They provide the infrastructure needed to streamline the trial process, from specifying
interventions to real-time data collection and analysis. In addition, digital N-of-1 platforms play a key role in the
adoption of N-of-1 studies, as traditional analog methods had limitations in their implementation.</p>

<p>On June 8, 2023, we had the honor of introducing StudyU to Prof. Dr. Karl Lauterbach,
the German Federal Minister of Health, during his visit to the Digital Health Cluster at the
Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI). In a engaging discussion with senior researcher Dr. Stefan Konigorski,
the minister was able to gain firsthand knowledge about how StudyU offers an empowering opportunity
to develop individualized care plans and enhance patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Prof. Lauterbach was already aware of how N-of-1 trials have the potential to provide personalized
insights into treatment effectiveness. However, he was impressed to learn that StudyU enables the
digital conduction of these trials, making them more accessible and convenient. The digital implementation
of N-of-1 trials through StudyU left a lasting positive impression on him, emphasizing the platform's
capability to advance personalized healthcare research.</p>
<p>We want to thank Prof. Dr. Karl Lauterbach for taking his time to visit the Digital Health Cluster at HPI
to learn more about StudyU and other ongoing digital health research projects.</p>

<p>StudyU has won the <b>Best Idea Award 2022</b> of the School Of Entrepreneurship at Hasso Plattner
Institute (HPI). The team consists of Pauline Gieseler and Johannes Vedder, who are both
students at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany.</p>
<p>Winning this award grants us the opportunity to <b>visit HPI New York City</b> and meet its director,
Dr. Joann Halpern. Additionally, it enables us to establish connections with HPI･MS, a collaborative
project between HPI and <a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mount Sinai Health System</a>, renowned as one
of the world's top-ranked hospitals.</p>
<p>With these new possibilities, our goal is to further enhance the development of StudyU, so that a
greater number of individuals will be able to experience the advantages of personalized healthcare
interventions.</p>
<p>Many thanks to everyone who voted for us!</p>
