On May 22, 2025, Dr. Stefan Konigorski, Senior Researcher in the chair of Digital Health & Machine
Learning and Adjunct Assistant Professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New
York, delivered a presentation titled "Digital N-of-1 trials to support patients and clinical
decision making" at the digital health partnership workshop of the Hasso Plattner Institute and the
Mount Sinai hospital in New York City.
<!-- truncate --> In his talk, Dr. Konigorski introduced StudyU, an open-source platform designed
to facilitate the design and execution of digital N-of-1 trials. These trials focus on
individualized treatment assessments, allowing researchers and clinicians to evaluate the effects
of interventions on a single participant over time.
StudyU comprises two main components: the StudyU Designer, a web-based tool enabling researchers
to collaboratively design and publish trials, and the StudyU App, a mobile application that
allows participants to engage with the trials and monitor their health outcomes.

Dr. Konigorski emphasized the potential of digital N-of-1 trials to revolutionize personalized
medicine by providing tailored insights into treatment efficacy for individual patients. He
discussed how platforms like StudyU can democratize evidence generation, making it more accessible
for both researchers and participants. The integration of such digital tools into clinical practice
could lead to more informed decision-making and improved patient outcomes.

The talk highlighted the growing interest in leveraging digital technologies to enhance clinical
research methodologies. StudyU exemplifies the innovative approaches being developed to advance
personalized healthcare through the use of digital platforms and individualized trial designs.
